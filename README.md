# POINT-OF-SALE-SYSTEM
THIS SYSTEM IS CREATED AND GRADUALLY IMPROVED DEPENDING ON THE TECH STACK THAT IM LEARNING

GOAL: Master HTML, CSS and JS including a Node js backen and creating another branch of the backend using django python 

  -I already have a background on these languages but i dont think i mastered them in a way that i can code fully without ai contributing to my code so this is my way to master coding without ai so i am fully committed to coding without ai 

Week 1
Day-1 - Starting the frontend of the system using HTML and CSS 
Day-2 - Created the frontend of the header and product grid
Day-3 - Started the Cart side of the point of sale system
Day-4 - Finished the cart side of the POS
Day-5 - Started the Login frontend of the Point of Sale system
Day-6 - designed the First half of the point of sale 
      - here i realized my mistakes its hard to design if the text is already in the logo
        so i would try to re design and change the color of everything tommorow
        and i would try to make my code more efficient
